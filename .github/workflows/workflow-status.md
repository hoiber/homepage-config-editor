# GitHub Workflows Status

This file tracks the current status and fixes applied to GitHub Actions workflows.

## Fixed Issues

### 1. CI Workflow (ci.yml) ✅
**Issues Fixed:**
- ❌ Tests were failing due to incorrect text matching
- ❌ Docker test was trying to run nginx on Node.js container  
- ❌ Wrong health check endpoint and port

**Solutions Applied:**
- ✅ Updated tests to match actual application content
- ✅ Fixed Docker test to use correct ports (3001 for live, 80 for static)
- ✅ Updated health check endpoints (/api/health for live, / for static)
- ✅ Added separate tests for both live and static Docker builds

### 2. Test Suite (App.test.js) ✅
**Issues Fixed:**
- ❌ Default test searched for non-existent "learn react" text
- ❌ Multiple element conflicts with same text content

**Solutions Applied:**
- ✅ Replaced with actual application-specific tests
- ✅ Tests now verify core functionality: header, navigation, basic structure
- ✅ Simplified to avoid element conflicts

### 3. Docker Multi-Architecture (docker-multi.yml) ✅
**New Features Added:**
- ✅ Multi-platform builds (linux/amd64, linux/arm64)
- ✅ Separate builds for live and static versions
- ✅ Proper tagging strategy with suffixes
- ✅ Optimized caching strategy

## Current Workflow Status

| Workflow | Status | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| **ci.yml** | ✅ Fixed | Test builds, run tests, Docker validation |
| **docker-build.yml** | ✅ Working | Build and push main Docker images |
| **docker-multi.yml** | ✅ New | Multi-arch builds for both variants |
| **release.yml** | ✅ Updated | Create releases with proper metadata |

## Known Issues

### Minor Issues (Non-blocking)
1. **Duplicate React Key Warning**: 
   - Issue: `portainer` key appears twice in commonServices object
   - Impact: Console warning in development, no functional impact
   - Status: Low priority fix needed

2. **Test Coverage**: 
   - Current: ~10% code coverage
   - Target: >80% coverage
   - Status: Improvement planned

## Workflow Commands

```bash
# Trigger CI manually
git push origin main

# Test locally before push
npm test -- --coverage --ci --passWithNoTests --watchAll=false
npm run build
docker build -t test .

# Check workflow status
gh run list --workflow=ci.yml
```

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Monitor next push to ensure all workflows pass
2. **Short-term**: Increase test coverage
3. **Medium-term**: Add integration tests for Docker containers
4. **Long-term**: Add security scanning workflows

## Validation Checklist

Before merging changes:
- [ ] All tests pass locally
- [ ] Both Docker images build successfully  
- [ ] No critical security vulnerabilities
- [ ] Documentation updated if needed
